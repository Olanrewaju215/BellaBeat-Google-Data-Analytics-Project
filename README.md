# BellaBeat-Google-Data-Analytics-Project
SCENARIO:

I will be showcasing my understanding of the data analysis process which is:
You are a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. Urška Sršen (aliased as U.S, the cofounder & Chief Creative Officer) believes that analyzing smart device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company.

You have been asked to focus on one of Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices which will help guide the marketing strategy for the company.

Products:

Bellabeat app: Provides users with health data related to their activity, sleep, stress, menstrual cycle, and mindfulness habits.
Leaf: A wellness tracker that can be worn as a bracelet, necklace, or clip. Connects with the Bellabeat app to track activity, sleep, and stress.
Time: A wellness watch with smart technology to track user activity, sleep, and stress. Connects to the Bellabeat app to provide insight into daily wellness
Spring: A water bottle that tracks daily water intake using smart technology to ensure you are adequately hydrated. Connects to the Bellabeat app to track hydration levels.
Bellabeat membership: A subscription-based membership program that gives users 24/7 access to fully personalized guidance on nutrition, activity, sleep, health, beauty, and mindfulness based on their lifestyle and goals.

**About the company**
Bellabeat is a high-tech company that manufactures health-focused smart products which are beautifully developed by the U.S. that informs and inspires women around the world regarding their activity, sleep, stress & reproductive health.

Bellabeat has also invested in traditional advertising media, such as radio, out-of-home billboards, print, and television but focuses on digital marketing extensively such as investing in Google Search, maintaining active Facebook & Instagram pages, consistently engaging consumers on Twitter, running video ads on Youtube and displays ads on the Google Display Network to support campaigns around key marketing dates.

The U.S. knows that an analysis of Bellabeat’s available consumer data would reveal more opportunities for worth. She has asked the marketing analytics team to focus on a Bellabeat product and analyze smart device usage data to gain insight into how people are using their smart devices. Using this information, she would like high-level recommendations for how these trends can inform Bellabeat's marketing strategy.


Research Question
1. What are some trends in smart device usage?

2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?

3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat's marketing strategy?

PREPARE

We will utilize Fitbit Fitness Tracker Data, which comprises the personal fitness tracker data of thirty Fitbit users who have provided their consent for the submission of their personal tracking information. This dataset provides minute-level data on:

Physical activity
Heart rate
Sleep monitoring
Additionally, it includes details regarding daily activity, step counts, and heart rate measurements, enabling us to analyze and gain insights into user behavior.

As the files are already arranged in a designated folder, there is no requirement for further organization. The file names are also straightforward to identify within the context of the data, so there is no need for any modifications to them.

SUMMARY OF FINDINGS

Based on my analysis results, I'd like to present my thoughts on the project.

It appears that users allocate more of their time to physical activities, particularly on Sundays. Subsequently, this commitment tends to decrease as the week progresses, experiencing a minor upturn on Thursdays, followed by a gradual rise on Saturdays.

My suspicion is as follows:

During weekends, users may exhibit higher levels of motivation and have more free time, creating opportunities for them to incorporate workouts into their schedules.
As the workload diminishes, a window of opportunity for exercise emerges in the middle of the week, notably on Thursdays.
Fridays seem to record the lowest activity levels, possibly due to social engagements with friends or coworkers after work hours.

To address the ultimate business objective, I'd like to present my recommendations, which are derived from my findings, aimed at guiding Bellabeat's marketing strategy.

Bellabeat has the opportunity to organize exclusive events exclusively for Bellabeat members, providing incentives to users committed to a healthy lifestyle (e.g., achieving 8,000 daily steps or less than 7 hours of sedentary time). These events could reward participants with points, which users can later redeem for products that complement a healthy lifestyle.

Another avenue Bellabeat could explore is forging partnerships with brands in the wellness, sports, and health sectors. This collaboration could enable Bellabeat to offer coupons and store discounts to users who consistently embrace a healthy lifestyle.

By combining these two aforementioned approaches, Bellabeat could identify individuals who have transitioned from an unhealthy to a healthy lifestyle with the help of their products. They could conduct interviews with these individuals and produce motivational videos showcasing how Bellabeat played a pivotal role in transforming their lives.

Moving forward, I'd like to offer some general recommendations for enhancing Bellabeat's product offerings:

Bellabeat has the potential to introduce personalized milestones aimed at gradually motivating users to adopt a healthier lifestyle. A possible approach involves incorporating an AI companion within the app or product that displays a less cheerful demeanor if users fail to meet their milestones.

Another suggestion is for Bellabeat to integrate a straightforward reminder system that notifies users when they've been inactive for an extended period. This reminder could take the form of continuous device vibrations, ceasing only when the device detects movement or an increase in heart rate, signifying engagement in physical activity.
